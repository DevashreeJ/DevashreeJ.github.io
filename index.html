                           <br><br>
                            <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 14px; font-style: italic;">Walt Disney was born on December 5, 1901 in Chicago Illinois, to his father Elias Disney, and mother Flora Call Disney. Walt was one of five children, four boys and a girl.
                            After Walt’s birth, the Disney family moved to Marceline Missouri, Walt lived most of his childhood here.Walt had very early interests in art, he would often sell drawings to neighbors to make extra money. He pursued his art career, by studying art and photography by going to McKinley High School in Chicago.Walt began to love, and appreciate nature and wildlife, and family and community, which were a large part of agrarian living. Though his father could be quite stern, and often there was little money, Walt was encouraged by his mother, and older brother, Roy to pursue his talents.During the fall of 1918, Disney attempted to enlist for military service. Rejected because he was under age, only sixteen years old at the time. Instead, Walt joined the Red Cross and was sent overseas to France, where he spent a year driving an ambulance and chauffeuring Red Cross officials. His ambulance was covered from stem to stern, not with stock camouflage, but with Disney cartoons.Once Walt returned from France, he began to pursue a career in commercial art. He started a small company called Laugh-O-Grams, which eventually fell bankrupt. With his suitcase, and twenty dollars, Walt headed to Hollywood to start anew.
                            After making a success of his “Alice Comedies,” Walt became a recognized Hollywood figure.
                            In 1932, the production entitled Flowers and Trees(the first color cartoon) won Walt the first of his studio’s Academy Awards. In 1937, he released The Old Mill, the first short subject to utilize the multi-plane camera technique.On December 21, 1937, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, the first full-length animated musical feature, premiered at the Carthay Theater in Los Angeles. The film produced at the unheard cost of $1,499,000 during the depths of the Depression, the film is still considered one of the great feats and imperishable monuments of the motion picture industry. During the next five years, Walt Disney Studios completed other full-length animated classics such as Pinocchio, Fantasia, Dumbo, and Bambi.Walt Disney’s dream of a clean, and organized amusement park, came true, as Disneyland Park opened in 1955. Walt also became a television pioneer, Disney began television production in 1954, and was among the first to present full-color programming with his Wonderful World of Color in 1961. Walt Disney is a legend; a folk hero of the 20th century. By 62–years–of–age, Walt had won 31 Academy Awards.One of his most famous quotes that will always keep generations inspired paraphrases his entire life: 
                                <br><em>If you dream it, you can do it !</em><br><br> 
                             Walt Disney has always been my inspiration. As a kid his movies motivated me and as a professional developer, his designs. Designing and animation requires an immense amount of precision. Web development and web design requires the same amount of precision nd accuracy. Being a web developer brings me closer to my childhood and my inspiration. With all the requied skills and passion, I think I can perform well as a web developer and work twice as hard to get the required outcome. I am a hardworking, analytical and a dynamic person eager to take up new tasks and learn new technologies and frameworks. It is my dream to develop the best site there is and according to the famous quote stated above, I will do it someday soon.

                <strong>Error logger of application - Website</strong><br>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Created a website using Asp.Net MVC framework and associated the same with a database using Entity framework. This Website displays the logged errors to user owning the application. The Website is created for user and Admin ends. Designed rest service to store data coming from the applications and then pushed the data from rest service into a Database.</p><br>             
              
                             
                <strong>Code Analyzer</strong><br>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Created a type table of specific tokens using a code analyzer and implemented a dependency table mapping the various files depending on each other using this type table. The code analyzer would be executed on various folders of .cpp and .h files to extract method names to show dependencies using C++.</p><br>

                <strong>Code Publisher</strong><br>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Published code on the browser through HTML files. The copying of content from source (.cpp or .h) file to HTML file was performed through code. This project also gives the user the flexibility of collapsing code in various scopes. This project used the integration of CSS, JavaScript and HTML with C++.</p><br>
                
                <strong>Help on the Go -  Android application</strong><br>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Created an android application which used google maps API, Firebase by google and animations to enhance the look and feel. This application provided the details of the people who are willing to provide service during an emergency. User can call the person and view his location in the map. Based on the location, the user can decide whom to call. This application had two kinds of accounts; user account and service provider account who can view each other ont the application. The service provider is notified when the user requests for their assistance.</p><br>

                 <strong>ChatBot -  Web Application</strong><br>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Created a responsive web application using Angular 5 and Dialogflow for developing intent based communication between user and chatbot. Configured this chatbot for small talk and understand the intent of the user through key words. </p><br>
